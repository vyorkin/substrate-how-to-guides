# Part IV: Interacting with your Kitties
_This is tutorial steps you through building a fully functional dapp for managing Substrate Kitties._

## Goal

Learn how to create the dispatchable functions for the Kitty pallet.
## Overview

With parts I, II and III of this tutorial, we've build the core components of our NFT chain. Users can now create and track ownership of
their Kitties.

In this part of the tutorial, we want to make our runtime more
like a game by introducing other functions like buying and 
selling. In order to achieve this, we'll need to enable users 
to update the price of their Kitty. Then we can add functionality to transfer, buy and breed Kitties.

## Steps

### 1. Set a price for each Kitty

#### A. Updating a stored struct
Every Kitty object has a price attribute that we have set to 0 as default. 
If we want to update the price of a Kitty, we will need to:
- pull down the Kitty object;
- update the price; 
- push it back into storage.

:::note Remember that Rust expects you to declare a variable as mutable if the value is going to be updated.
:::

Changing a value from an existing struct would be written in the following way:

```rust
let mut object = Self::get_object(object_id);
object.value = new_value;

<Objects<T>>::insert(object_id, object);
```

#### B. Permissioned functions

As we create functions which modify objects, we 
should check that only the appropriate users are successful in 
making those calls.

For modifying a Kitty object, we will need to get the owner of 
Kitty, and ensure that it is the same as the sender.

`KittyOwner` stores a mapping to an `Option<T::AccountId>` since a 
given Hash may not point to a generated and owned Kitty yet. 
This means, whenever we fetch the owner of a kitty, we need to 
resolve the possibility that it returns `None`. This could be 
caused by bad user input or even some sort of problem with our 
runtime. Checking will help prevent these kinds of problems.

An ownership check for our module will look something like this:

```rust
let owner = Self::owner_of(object_id).ok_or("No owner for this object")?;

ensure!(owner == sender, "You are not the owner");
```

#### C. Sanity checks
In a similar vain of checking permissions, we also need to ensure that our runtime is consistently doing sanity
checks so that we do not allow users to break our chain. If we 
are creating a function which updates the value of an object, 
the first thing we better do is make sure the object exists at all.

Using `ensure!` we can create a safe guard against poor user input, whether malicious or unintentional. For example:

```rust
ensure!(<MyObject<T>>::exists(object_id));
```

:::tip Your turn! 
You now have all the tools necessary to write the `set_price` dispatchable function. Remember, "verify first, write last": be sure to perform the appropriate checks before you modify storage, and don't assume that the user is giving you 
good data to work with!

### 2. Transfer a Kitty 

Our pallet's storage items already handles ownership of Kitties
&mdash; this means that all our `transfer_kitty` function needs to do is update our storage state. These storage items are: 
- `KittyOwner`: to update the owner of the Kitty
- `OwnedKittiesArray`: to update the owned Kitty map for each acount
- `OwnedKittiesIndex`: to update the owned Kitty index for each owner
- `OwnedKittiesCount`: to update the amount of Kitties a account has 

You already have the tools you'll need to create the transfer functionality from section 1. The main difference in how we will 
create this dispatchable is that it will have two parts to it:
- **a dispatchable function called `transfer()`:** this what's exposed by your pallet.
- **a private function called `transfer_from()`:** this will be a helper function called by `transfer()` to handle all storage updates for transferring a Kitty

Separating the logic this way makes the private `transfer_from()` function reusable 
by other dispatchable functions of our pallet, without needing to rewrite the same logic over and over again. In our case, we're going to reuse it for
the `buy_kitty` dispatchable we're creating in the next section.

:::tip Your turn!
**Tip:** Start by writing the `transfer_from()` function, making sure you've included all the necessary state changes. Don't forget to "verify first, write last"!

### 3. Buy a Kitty
#### A. Check a Kitty is for Sale
We can use the `set_price()` function to check if the Kitty is for sale. We've simplified things such that any Kitty with the
price of 0 means that the Kitty is not for sale.

#### B. Making a Payment
In the previous step, we've added the functions necessary to transfer the ownership of our
Kitty NFTs. But there's no actual specification over a 
currency transfer that would happen if the Kitty was bought or sold. In this step we'll learn how to use FRAME's Currency trait to adjust account balances 
using its associated [`transfer` method][transfer-currency-rustdocs]. 


It's useful to understand why it's important to use the `transfer` method in particular and how we'll be accessing it. The reason we'll be using it is to ensure our runtime has the same understanding of currency throughout the pallets
it interacts with. The way that we ensure this is to use the `Currency` trait
from [`frame_support`][frame-balances-rustdocs]. Conveniently, it handles a 
`Balance` type, making it compatible with `pallet_balances` which we've been 
using from our pallet's configuration trait. Here's how the `transfer` 
function we'll be using is structured (from the Rust docs):
```rust
fn transfer(
    source: &AccountId,
    dest: &AccountId,
    value: Self::Balance,
    existence_requirement: ExistenceRequirement
) -> DispatchResult
```

In order to use this function, we'll need to import `Currency` and `ExistenceRequirement` from `frame_support`. 

#### C. Putting it all together: "Verify First, Write Last"

Now that we've gone over the necessary components for our `buy_kitty` dispatchable function,
you have everything you need to know to put it together &mdash; you're in the drivers seat! Use the following points as 
a guide to write `buy_kitty` from scratch.

**Basic sanity checks**
- it will take 3 arguments: `origin`, `kitty_id` and `max_price`
- check that `kitty_id` corresponds to a Kitty in storage
- check that the Kitty has an owner

**Check if purchasing Kitty is authorized**
- check that the account buying the Kitty doesn't already own it
- check that the price of the Kitty is not zero (if it is, throw an error)
- check that the Kitty price is not greater than `ask_price`

**Update storage items**
- use the `transfer` method from the `Currency` trait to update
account balances 
- use our pallet's `transfer_from` function to change the ownership
of the Kitty from `owner` to `sender`
- update the price of the Kitty to the price it was sold at

Write the `buy_kitty` following what's outlined above.

### 4. Breed Kitties

The logic behind breeding two Kitties is to multiply each corresponding DNA segment from two Kitties, 
resulting in a new DNA sequence. Then, that DNA is used when minting a new Kitty. Here's what that
looks like in code:

```rust
            let kitty_1 = Self::kitty(kitty_id_1);
            let kitty_2 = Self::kitty(kitty_id_2);

            let mut final_dna = kitty_1.dna;
            for (i, (dna_2_element, r)) in kitty_2
                .dna
                .as_ref()
                .iter()
                .zip(random_hash.as_ref().iter())
                .enumerate()
            {
                if r % 2 == 0 {
                    final_dna.as_mut()[i] = *dna_2_element;
                }
            }
```

This dispatchable must take the two different Kitties as user inputs and will use the `mint()` function to create the new Kitty.
