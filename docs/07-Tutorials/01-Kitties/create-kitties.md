In this part of the tutorial, we'll build out the components of our pallet 
needed to manage the creation and ownership of our Kitties.

## Overview



## Steps

### 1. Create the Kitty struct

#### A. Understanding what information to include

Structs are a useful tool to help carry information that corresponds to the same object. 
For our purposes, instead of using separate storage items for each of our Kitty traits, 
we can store this information in a single struct. This comes in handy when trying to optimize
for storage reads and writes. Let's first go over what information a single Kitty carries:

- `id`: a unique hash to identify each Kitty.
- `dna`: the hash used to identify the DNA of a Kitty, which corresponds to its unique features.
DNA is also used to breed new Kitties and to keep track of different Kitty generations.
- `price`: this is a balance that corresponds to the amount needed to buy a Kitty and 
determined by its owner.
- `gender`: an enum that can be either `Male` or `Female`.

:::note You could ofcourse add whichever additional pieces of information you want to your Kitty struct. In this tutorial, we're going to keep things simple.
:::

#### B. Writing out the struct
Now that we know what to include in our Kitty struct, let's recap the basics of declaring a struct.
Any struct has the following format:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Encode, Decode, Default, PartialEq)]
pub struct SomeStruct<SomeType1, SomeType2> {
    value_1: SomeType1,
    value_2: SomeType2,
}
```
We use the derive macro to include various helper types for using our struct. 

:::tip Your turn!
Write out the Kitty struct and include all the essential values. 
**HINT**: it will take `Hash` and `Balance` as its types.
Have a look at [this how-to guide](../../pallet-design/storage-value-struct) 
:::
#### C. Adding the `Hash` dependency
We already know the types of the different items in our struct. There's `Hash`, `Balance` and `Gender`. 

For `Gender`, we'll need to build out our own custom enum and functions. Similarly, `Balance` 
will be something we define in our configuration trait. However, we can start by importing 
the `Hash` types from the `frame_support` library. Write this at the top of your pallet where 
the dependencies are declared:

```rust
	use frame_support::sp_runtime::traits::{Hash};
```

#### D. Adding the custom `Gender` dependency

`Gender` will have three parts to it:
1. An enum declaration
2. A function to configure a defaut value 

Setting up our `Gender` enum this way allows us to derive a Kitty's gender by the randomness
created by each Kitty's DNA.

#### E. Enums

Writing enums requires us to use the derive macro which must precede the enum declaration. 

A typical enum would be structured like such:

```rust
	#[derive(Encode, Decode, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
	pub enum TypicalEnum {
		One,
		Two,
	}
```

Then, we can write out the default implementation by using Rust's [`Default` trait][default-rustdocs].
This would look something like this:

```rust
	impl Default for TypicalEnum {
		fn default() -> Self {
			TypicalEnum::One
		}
	}
```
It's like saying: we're giving our enum a special trait that allows us to initialize it to a specific value.
Great, we now know how to create a custom struct and specify its default value. But what about providing
a way for a Kitty struct to be assigned a gender value? For that we need to learn one more thing. 
#### F. Configuring functions for our Kitty struct

Configuring a struct is useful in order to pre-define a value in our struct. For example, if we want to 
set a value according to what another function returns. In our case we have a similar situation where 
we need to configure our Kitty struct in such a way that sets `Gender` according to a Kitty's DNA. We'll
only be using this function when we're creating Kitties but let's learn how to write it now and get it out
of the way.

When you're implementing the configuration trait for a struct inside a FRAME pallet, you're doing the 
same type of thing as implementing some trait for an enum except you're implementing the generic
configuration trait, `Config`. 

Building off our previous example, this would look like:

```rust
impl<T: Config> TypicalEnum {
		pub fn special_function(some_hash: T::Hash) -> TypicalEnum {
			if some_hash.as_ref()[0] % 2 == 0 {
				TypicalEnum::One
			} else {
				TypicalEnum::Two
			}
		}
	}
```
Now whenever `special_function` is called inside our pallet, it will return the enum value associated with
the function's logic.

:::tip Your turn!
Write out the `Gender` enum, trait implementations and `Config` implementation to define the behaviour
of `Gender` for our `Kitties` struct.
:::
### 2. Create and use the Randomness trait

If we want to be able to tell these Kitties apart, we need to start giving them unique properties! 
For our dapp, we need to generate a unique ID for each Kitty and some random DNA.

We'll be using the [Randomness trait][randomness-rustdocs] from `frame_support` to generate a random seed which we'll need 
to breed and create new unique Kitties. Alongside this trait, we'll also need a nonce which we'll create as a separate function
and a hashing function which we'll get by using the [`Hash` trait][hash-rustdocs] from `sp_runtime`.

Here's what our random hashing function looks like:

```rust
        fn random_hash(sender: &T::AccountId) -> T::Hash {
            let nonce = <Nonce<T>>::get();
            let seed = T::Randomness::random_seed();

            T::Hashing::hash_of(&(seed, &sender, nonce))
        }
```

In order to implement the `Randomness` trait for our runtime, we must: 

**1. Specify it in our pallet's configuration trait**

The `Randomness` trait from `frame_support` requires specifying it with a paramater to replace the `Output` generic.
Take a look at the documentation and the source code implementation to understand how this works. For our purposes,
we want the output of functions using this trait to be [`H256`][h256-rustdocs]:

```rust
		type KittyRandomness: Randomness<H256>; 
```

**2. Specify it for our runtime.**

Given that we're adding a new type for the configuration of our pallet, we need to tell our runtime about its implementation
This could come in handy if ever we wanted to change the algorithm that `KittyRandomness` is using, without needing to
modify where it's used inside our pallet.

To showcase this point, we're going to implement `KittyRandomness` by assigning it to an instance of [FRAME's `RandomnessCollectiveFlip`][randomness-collective-flip-frame]. 
This requires you to integrate the `RandomnessCollectiveFlip` pallet to your runtime and implement it. Once you do that, inside your
`runtime/lib.rs` file, include your `KittyRandomness` type for your runtime:

```rust
impl pallet_kitties::Config for Runtime {
	type KittyRandomness = RandomCollectiveFlip;
}
```

:::note why our random hashing function needs a nonce

Our goal is to create as much entropy as we can for `hash_of` to produce enough randomness when creating Kitty IDs and DNA. 
Since `random_seed()` does not change for multiple transactions in the same 
block, and since it may not even generate a 
random seed for the first 80 blocks, we need to create a nonce for our pallet to manage and use in our private `random_hash` function.  
:::
#### Nonce
We'll use the nonce provided by [`frame_system::AccountInfo`][nonce-rustdocs] and create a storage item to keep track of it as we change it. 
So we'll need to do a couple things:
- create a storage item for the nonce value 

```rust
	#[pallet::storage]
    #[pallet::getter(fn get_nonce)]
    pub(super) type Nonce<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, u64, ValueQuery>;
```
- create a function that increments the nonce

```rust
fn increment_nonce() -> DispatchResult {
            <Nonce<T>>::try_mutate(|nonce| {
                let next = nonce.checked_add(1).ok_or(Error::<T>::NonceOverflow)?;
                *nonce = next;

                Ok(().into())
            })
        }
```
:::tip Your turn!

Feel free to use the code snippets above in your pallet. Make sure to 
include the `Nonce` storage item among the section with your other storage items, and the 
`increment_nonce()` function in the helper function section.
:::
#### Unique Kitty ID

To easily track all of our kitties, it would be helpful to standardize our logic to use a unique id as the global key 
for our storage items. This means that a single unique key will point to our Kitty object, and all other links to ownership 
will point to that key.

The ID on the Kitty object will serve that purpose, but we need to make sure that the ID for a new Kitty is always unique. 
We can do this with a new storage item Kitties which will be a mapping from ID (Hash) to the Kitty object.

With this object, we can easily check for collisions by simply checking whether this storage item already contains a mapping 
using a particular ID. For example:

```rust
ensure!(!<Kitties<T>>::exists(new_id), "This new id already exists");
```

:::tip Your turn!
Let's update our pallet to include the helper functions to handle a Nonce update and a random generator. We will use that random data to create unique IDs which
 will be the basis for our NFT logic.
:::

### 3. Include storage items

There's a total of 9 storage items we'll be needing 
for our Kitty pallet. We already included `Nonce` and we've already created the basis for 
our Kitty object &mdash; we just need to implement a way to keep track of it now!

Every storage item declaration will follow a similar
pattern as when we wrote the storage item for `Nonce`. The only difference is which data structure type each storage item requires.

To create a storage instance for the Kitty struct,
we'll be using `StorageMap` &mdash; a hash-map provided
to us by FRAME. This differs from the storage instance we created for 
`Nonce` which, because we want it to keep track of a single `u64` value, we used `StorageValue`. 

Here's the basic pattern for declaring a storage map storage item, showing the storage for Kitty objects as an example:

```rust
	#[pallet::storage]
    #[pallet::getter(fn kitty)]
    pub(super) type Kitties<T: Config> =
        StorageMap<_, Twox64Concat, T::Hash, Kitty<T::Hash, T::Balance>, ValueQuery>;
```

Breaking it down, we declare the storage type and assign a `StorageMap` to it whereby:

- the [`Twox64Concat`][2x64-rustdocs] is the hashing algorithm used.
- a key of type `T::Hash` is used.
- a value of type `Kitty<T::Hash, T::Balance>` is used.

Our pallet's logic can be understood
by examining the storage items we'll be using. In other words, the way we define the conditions 
for reading and writing to our runtime's storage
help us breakdown the items we'll need to enable NFT capabilities. In our case, we care about state transitions and persistance around two main concepts our runtime needs to be made aware of:
1. unique assets, like currency or Kitties
2. helper datastructures, like the nonce, counters or account maps

This already starts to lay the foundations for our Kitty pallet logic. But there's an important layer beneath these two concepts: our runtime needs to have a sense of asset ownership as well as the ability to keep track of changes in ownership and owned quantities.

In our application, ontop of keeping a single storage instance for Kitty objects, we need a number of storage items to keep track of:
- Kitties in existence
- Owned Kitties

The overarching pattern here is to keep track
of *who* and *what*. This boils down to the following storage items (in addition to `Kitties` and `Nonce`):

**Tracking ownership**
- `<KittyOwner<T>>`: Keeps track of what accounts own what Kitty.
- `<OwnedKittiesArray<T>>`: Keep track of who a Kitty is owned by.
- `<OwnedKittiesCount<T>>`: Keeps track of the total amount of Kitties owned.
- `<OwnedKittiesIndex<T>>`: Keeps track of all owned Kitties by index.

**Tracking existing Kitties**
- `<AllKittiesArray<T>>`: An index to track of all Kitties.
- `<AllKittiesCount<T>>`: Stores the total amount of Kitties in existence.
- `<AllKittiesIndex<T>>`: Keeps track of all the Kitties.

:::tip Your turn!
Use the storage items declared above to write the remaining storage items for your pallet.

**HINT**: Remember to include a getter function for each storage item &mdash; except those handling indices (they'll only get written;)) .
:::

Congratulations! If you've made it this far, you now have the foundations for your pallet to
handle the creation and ownership of unique assets. 

Run this command to check that your pallet compiles correctly: 
```rust
cargo build -p pallet-kitties
```
